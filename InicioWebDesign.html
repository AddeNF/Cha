           <p> This is when our schoolband played at a song contest. </p>

            <p> Last year in May, the schoolband I'm in went to play at a nationwide song contest with participants from the IES schools. <br> We were practicing since February and eventually "perfected" the song. <br> 23rd May 2019 we took the train to Sundsvall and stayed overnight to compete the next day. We didn't win but we had a lot of fun :). </p>
